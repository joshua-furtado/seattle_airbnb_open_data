# Seattle Airbnb Open Data

## Motivation

From the Seattle Airbnb Open Data we would like to answer the following questions:

- Does time of the year influence prices? If so, what are the best times of the year to visit Seattle?
- What are the main factors which affect reservation prices?
- What percentage of listings are overpriced, a fair deal or even a great deal?
